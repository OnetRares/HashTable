# 🚀 Hash Table Implementation in C++

# 📌 Overview

his project implements a hash table in C++ with separate chaining for collision resolution. The hash table supports dynamic resizing, insertion, deletion, lookup, and iteration through stored key-value pairs.

It also includes a menu-driven console application that allows users to interact with the hash table using standard input.

# 🔧 Features

**Uses separate chaining** (linked lists) to handle collisions.

**Dynamically resizes** when the load factor exceeds a predefined threshold.

**Efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup** operations.

**Operator overloading** for easy key-based access.

**Console-based menu** for interactive use.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
C++ Standard Library (STL): For vectors and lists.

Templates: Allow generic key-value storage.

Exception Handling: Ensures robust error handling.
